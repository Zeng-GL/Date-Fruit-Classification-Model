# Date-Fruit-Classification-Model

### Problem Statement:
In food production it is important to properly label ingredients for both health and business reasons. However, sometimes mistakes are made and there is room for improvement in food labeling practices. A number of different types of dates are grown around the world, and it takes expertise to correctly identify the variety. Your job as a machine learning developer is to create a model that can identify the type of date from external features such as colour, length, diameter and shape factors which have been determined by a computer vision model.


### Data:
Obtained from DATASETS (muratkoklu.com) and used in M. Koklu, R. Kursun, Y.S. Taspinar, and I. Cinar, "Classification of Date Fruits into Genetic Varieties Using Image Analysis," Mathematical Problems in Engineering, Vol.2021, Article ID: 4793293 (2021).

### Objective: 
To determine the variety of date fruit from data describing the colour, length, diameter, and shape.
